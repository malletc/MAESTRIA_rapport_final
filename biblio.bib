                  amortized inference distributions that are jointly trained
                  with the models. We find that existing training objectives for
                  variational autoencoders can lead to inaccurate amortized
                  inference distributions and, in some cases, improving the
                  objective provably degrades the inference quality. In
                  addition, it has been observed that variational autoencoders
                  tend to ignore the latent variables when combined with a
                  decoding distribution that is too flexible. We again identify
                  the cause in existing training criteria and propose a new
                  class of objectives (InfoVAE) that mitigate these problems. We
                  show that our model can significantly improve the quality of
                  the variational posterior and can make effective use of the
                  latent features regardless of the flexibility of the decoding
                  distribution. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative
                  analyses, we demonstrate that our models outperform competing
                  approaches on multiple performance metrics.},

                  Uncertainty Autoencoders, a learning framework for
                  unsupervised representation learning inspired by compressed
                  sensing. We treat the low-dimensional projections as noisy
                  latent representations of an autoencoder and directly learn
                  both the acquisition (i.e., encoding) and amortized recovery
                  (i.e., decoding) procedures. Our learning objective optimizes
                  for a tractable variational lower bound to the mutual
                  information between the datapoints and the latent
                  representations. We show how our framework provides a unified
                  treatment to several lines of research in dimensionality
                  reduction, compressed sensing, and generative modeling.
                  Empirically, we demonstrate a 32 \% improvement on average

                  have emerged as one of the most popular approaches
                  to unsupervised learning of complicated
                  distributions. VAEs are appealing because they are
                  built on top of standard function approximators
                  (neural networks), and can be trained with
                  stochastic gradient descent. VAEs have already shown
                  promise in generating many kinds of complicated
                  data, including handwritten digits, faces, house
                  numbers, CIFAR images, physical models of scenes,
                  segmentation, and predicting the future from static
                  images. This tutorial introduces the intuitions
                  behind VAEs, explains the mathematics behind them,
                  and describes some empirical behavior. No prior
                  knowledge of variational Bayesian methods is

                  This calls however for efficient methods able to
                  process time-series on a global scale. Building on
                  recent work employing multi-headed self-attention

                  we propose a modification of the Temporal Attention

                  heads operating in parallel. Each head extracts
                  highly-specialized temporal features which are in turn
                  concatenated into a single representation. Our

                  series classification algorithms on an open-access

  year =         2019,
  abstract =     {Learning generative models that span multiple data
                  modalities, such as vision and language, is often
                  motivated by the desire to learn more useful,
                  generalisable representations that faithfully capture
                  common underlying factors between the modalities. In
                  this work, we characterise successful learning of such
                  models as the fulfillment of four criteria: i)
                  implicit latent decomposition into shared and private
                  subspaces, ii) coherent joint generation over all
                  modalities, iii) coherent cross-generation across
                  individual modalities, and iv) improved model learning
                  for individual modalities through multi-modal
                  integration. Here, we propose a mixture-of-experts
                  multimodal variational autoencoder (MMVAE) to learn
                  generative models on different sets of modalities,
                  including a challenging image-language dataset, and
                  demonstrate its ability to satisfy all four criteria,
                  both qualitatively and quantitatively.},
