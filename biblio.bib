                  amortized inference distributions that are jointly trained
                  with the models. We find that existing training objectives for
                  variational autoencoders can lead to inaccurate amortized
                  inference distributions and, in some cases, improving the
                  objective provably degrades the inference quality. In
                  addition, it has been observed that variational autoencoders
                  tend to ignore the latent variables when combined with a
                  decoding distribution that is too flexible. We again identify
                  the cause in existing training criteria and propose a new
                  class of objectives (InfoVAE) that mitigate these problems. We
                  show that our model can significantly improve the quality of
                  the variational posterior and can make effective use of the
                  latent features regardless of the flexibility of the decoding
                  distribution. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative
                  analyses, we demonstrate that our models outperform competing
                  approaches on multiple performance metrics.},

                  which representations aligned with the underlying

                  optimising the modified ELBO bound in $\beta$-VAE, as

                  that progressively increases the information capacity
                  of the latent code during training. This modification
                  facilitates the robust learning of disentangled
                  representations in $\beta$-VAE, without the previous

                  Uncertainty Autoencoders, a learning framework for
                  unsupervised representation learning inspired by compressed
                  sensing. We treat the low-dimensional projections as noisy
                  latent representations of an autoencoder and directly learn
                  both the acquisition (i.e., encoding) and amortized recovery
                  (i.e., decoding) procedures. Our learning objective optimizes
                  for a tractable variational lower bound to the mutual
                  information between the datapoints and the latent
                  representations. We show how our framework provides a unified
                  treatment to several lines of research in dimensionality
                  reduction, compressed sensing, and generative modeling.
                  Empirically, we demonstrate a 32 \% improvement on average

                  to unsupervised learning of complicated
                  distributions. VAEs are appealing because they are
                  built on top of standard function approximators
                  (neural networks), and can be trained with
                  stochastic gradient descent. VAEs have already shown

                  numbers, CIFAR images, physical models of scenes,
                  segmentation, and predicting the future from static
                  images. This tutorial introduces the intuitions

                  and describes some empirical behavior. No prior

                  This calls however for efficient methods able to
                  process time-series on a global scale. Building on
                  recent work employing multi-headed self-attention

                  highly-specialized temporal features which are in turn
                  concatenated into a single representation. Our

                  series classification algorithms on an open-access
